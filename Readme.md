When copying and pasting into your GitHub README file, it's important to ensure that the markdown formatting is correctly interpreted. Here are a few tips to make sure it displays correctly:

1. **Make sure your file is named `README.md`.** The `.md` extension stands for Markdown, which GitHub automatically renders as formatted text.

2. **Check your text editor.** Some editors might inadvertently add extra spaces or characters when copying and pasting. Make sure your text is plain text.

3. **Preview on GitHub.** After pasting the text into the `README.md` file, commit the changes and then view the file on GitHub to see how it renders.

Here’s the same text, but just in case, you might want to manually ensure that it’s correctly formatted:

# Chatify - Chat App

Chatify is a real-time chat application built with a modern tech stack, including React for the frontend and Express.js for the backend. The application supports real-time communication, user authentication, and secure password management, and is designed to be easily deployable.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main folders:

- **Chatify** (Root Directory)
  - **Frontend**: Contains the React application.
  - **Backend**: Contains the Express server and all backend logic.

## Installation and Setup

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the `Frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd Chatify/Frontend
   ```

2. Create a new React application using Vite:
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest
   ```

3. Install the necessary npm packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Backend

1. Initialize the Node.js application in the root directory:
   ```bash
   cd Chatify
   npm init
   ```

2. Install the required npm packages for the backend:
   ```bash
   npm install express dotenv cookie-parser bcrypt mongoose socket.io jsonwebtoken
   ```

3. Ensure that your `package.json` file has the following entry:
   ```json
   "main": "server.js"
   ```

## npm Packages

The following npm packages are used in the backend:

- **express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework used to create the server.
- **dotenv**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.
- **cookie-parser**: Used to parse cookies attached to client requests.
- **bcrypt**: A library to help you hash passwords securely.
- **mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **socket.io**: Enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication.
- **jsonwebtoken**: A library to create and verify JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.

## Project Summary

Chatify is designed to be a robust and scalable chat application, focusing on secure user authentication and real-time communication. The project leverages modern tools and frameworks to ensure efficient development and deployment.

- **Frontend**: Built with React using Vite, which ensures a fast and optimized user interface.
- **Backend**: Powered by Express.js, with MongoDB used as the database, connected via Mongoose.
- **Security**: Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt, and user sessions are managed using JSON Web Tokens.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Implemented using Socket.io, providing seamless chat experiences.
